It is relatively easy to create and deploy fully featured applications with OutSystems even for a novice developer. The purpose of this study is to determine the main problems that the students of Lahti University of Applied Sciences experience and find out how these problems can be solved with OutSystems. The theoretical part of this study explains the choice of OutSystems as a Rapid Application Development Platform for creation and deployment of Mobile and Web applications and explains the basic concepts behind this technology. A survey and several interviews were conducted for data collection for this study. A mobile application and a web application implementing popular student services were developed as a part of the case study. Based on the conducted research, the conclusions about the preferred order and the optimal methods of development of the mobile applications for the student services were made. The suggestions about the design from the case study should also be taken into consideration in order to build an application to be accepted by the majority of the users.},
